# SmartPrint_print-job-scheduler
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an intelligent print queue management system that significantly improves job scheduling efficiency in shared printing environments such as universities, libraries, and offices.

The key outcome of this project is the development of an intelligent print queue management system that optimizes the 
scheduling of print jobs using well-known CPU scheduling algorithms such as Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and 
Shortest Job Next (SJN). The system enables efficient handling of multiple print jobs, reducing wait times and prioritizing 
urgent tasks to improve overall productivity in shared printing environments like offices, universities, and libraries. 
traditional FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) scheduling will conclude the project, showcasing enhanced efficiency and 
intelligent print job management 

The deliverables include a fully functional desktop application with a user-friendly graphical interface where users can 
submit print jobs with specific priorities and page counts. The system supports dynamic scheduling, allowing users to 
select different algorithms and observe their effects on print job execution.
